/** @addtogroup SPIRIT_Libraries        SPIRIT Libraries
 * @brief This firmware implements libraries which allow the user
 * to manage the features of Spirit without knowing the hardware details.
 * @details The <i>SPIRIT_Libraries</i> modules are totally platform independent. The library provides one
 * module for each device feature. Each module refers to some functions whose prototypes are located in the
 * header file <i>@ref MCU_Interface.h</i>. The user who want to use these libraries on a particular
 * platform has to implement these functions respecting them signatures.
