  * @brief   Configuration and management of SPIRIT direct transmission / receive modes.
  * @details
  *
  * This module contains functions to manage the direct Tx/Rx mode.
  * The user can choose the way to send data to Spirit through the
  * enumerative types <i>@ref DirectTx</i>/<i>@ref DirectRx</i>.
