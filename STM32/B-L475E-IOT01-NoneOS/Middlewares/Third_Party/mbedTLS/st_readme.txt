### 10-November-2017 ###
========================
   + Upgrade to use mbedTLS V2.6.1
   + fix missing prototype error,in the library/aes.c file, with EWARM toolchain when MBEDTLS_DEPRECATED_REMOVED is defined.


### 09-October-2017 ###
========================
   + Upgrade to use mbedTLS V2.6.0
   + Update the "net_socket_template.c" file to use LwIP API, this make it directly usable in the applications
   + Fix compiler warnings by including newer patches from the mbedTLS git tree


### 23-December-2016 ###
========================
   + Upgrade to use mbedTLS V2.4.0
   + Rename the "net_sockets.c" to "net_sockets_template.c" to provide the net_sockets.c actual implemtentation in user projects.
   + Fix warnings due to invalid code for 32 bit machines, see https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/issues/683


### 27-March-2015 ###
=====================
   + Add support of the hardware Cryptographic and Hash processors embedded in STM32F756xx devices.
     This support is activated by defining "USE_STM32F7XX_HW_CRYPTO" macro in PolarSSL config.h file.
   + Fix some compilation warnings 


### 13-March-2015 ###
=====================
   + Align to latest version of STM32Cube CRYP HAL driver: add initialization of Crypto handler's Instance field


### 18-February-2014 ###
========================
   + PolarSSL V1.2.8 customized version for STM32Cube solution.
   + Source files modified to support the hardware Cryptographic and Hash processors embedded in
     STM32F415xx/417xx/437xx/439xx devices. This support is activated by defining
     "USE_STM32F4XX_HW_CRYPTO" macro in PolarSSL config.h file.
